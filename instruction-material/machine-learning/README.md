## Machine learning

Some material in `01-ml-experimental-design.Rmd` is adapted from [Penn GCB 535](https://github.com/greenelab/GCB535).
It uses the dataset from that repo in `data/expression` and `data/metadata`, which can be downloaded with:

```
scripts/download-brca-data.sh
```

Material in `02-ml-biological-contexts.Rmd` has been adapted from [ALSF CCDL training materials](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/machine-learning).

We prepare the data (using `release-v19-20210423`) using the set up code [here](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/22ff7cf8f7f931cfe031062044f0a9e09b7d2565/machine-learning/setup).
